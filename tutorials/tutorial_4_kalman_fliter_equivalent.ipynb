To see why this happens try playing around with this interactive plot which shows the \"real time\" GP predictions up to a certain time and the forward looking predictions using the GP fit up to that time. You can see the forward looking predictions are always very smooth, but the immediate prediction is influenced by recent observations which cause the predictions to wander around a little more than you may expect."
