/*
 * These "Representations" relate to matrices build from covariance
 * functions, namely Positive Semi Definite (PSD) matrices.
 *
 * The most popular representation for such matrices is the
 * Cholesky, or related LDLT decomposition:
 *
 *   A = L D L^T
 *
 * But sometimes there are more efficient, or numerically
 * stable approaches which depend on the application.
 *
 * A covariance Representation is effectively just an
 * approach for efficiently storing and inverting the matrix
 * in question.

/*
 * The ExplainedCovariance represents a matrix of the form,
 *
 *     S = A B^{-1} A
 *
 * Where A is referred to as the outer and B as the inner matrix.
 * The solve (inverse) can then be performed by taking,
 *
 *     x = A^-1 B A^-1 rhs
 *
 * One example of where this sort of form shows up is in posterior
 * distributions of Gaussian processes.  Posterior covariances
 * often take the form:
 *
 *     post = prior - cross^T dependent^-1 cross
 *
 * Ie, the posterior covariance would be the prior covariance minus
 * the explained ( cross^T dependent^-1 cross ) covariance.
 * Here the explained covariance consists of the cross term which
 * may represent the relationship between the variable in
 * question and some dependent variable, and the dependent^-1 term
 * represents the inverse of the prior on the dependent variable.
 *
 * While (typically) the prior covariances are positive definite
 * it's much more likely that the explained covariance would be
 * positive SEMI definite which would happen in the case of an
 * underdetermined set of observations.  This particular
 * CovarianceRepresentation therefore avoids the inversion of B
 * if possible, under the assumption that it may be singular.
