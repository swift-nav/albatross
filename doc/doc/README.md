# albatross [![CI](https://github.com/swift-nav/albatross/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/swift-nav/albatross/actions/workflows/ci.yaml)
A framework for statistical modelling in C++, with a focus on Gaussian processes.

## Features
 * [Gaussian process regression](http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf) which is accomplished using composable covariance functions and templated predictor types.
 * Evaluation utilities, with a focus on cross validation.
 * Written using generics in an attempt to make these core routines applicable to a number of fields.
 * Parameter handling which makes it easy to get and set parameters in a standardized way  as well as compose and (de)serialize models to string.
